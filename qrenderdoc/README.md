# Windows build

Until qrenderdoc is ready, you need to download some dependencies to build:

* Qt
* Python
* PySide2
* SWIG (custom fork)

Download [this zip](https://renderdoc.org/qrenderdoc_3rdparty.zip) and unzip to this folder (the 3rdparty/ in the zip should go into the 3rdparty/ folder here) before building.
